Emmanuel came in with his one owner Honda Accord looking for a change. Decided with a color shifting vinyl from back to green. The headlights were also yellowed due to age and were replaced with new aftermarket ones. As well as the rear taillights with a smoked lens. The car was fully Chrome deleted as well including the windowtrim, bumper trim and emblems.
